Here is what we have done for Test Case part

This test case focus on testing authentication-related views based on Assignment 1. Here's an overview of each method within the test case:

accounts/test.py

setUp(self)
Creates a user for testing purposes.
Defines URLs for login, registration, and dashboard for easier access in test methods.
test_register_view_get(self)
Tests the HTTP GET method on the register view.
Retrieves the registration page and checks if it returns a status code of 200 (OK).
Asserts that the response contains the text 'Register'.
test_register_view_post(self)
Tests the HTTP POST method on the register view (user creation).
Simulates user registration by sending a POST request with user details.
Verifies if a new user is successfully created by checking the count of User objects.
test_login_view_post(self)
Tests user login by simulating a POST request to the login endpoint.
Logs in with a user created in setUp.
Checks if the response redirects to the dashboard upon successful login.
test_dashboard_access(self)
Tests access to the dashboard view after logging in.
Logs in with a user created in setUp.
Retrieves the dashboard page and checks if it returns a status code of 200 (OK).
These tests aim to validate the functionalities related to user registration, login, and dashboard access in the Django application by simulating various HTTP requests and asserting the expected outcomes.


files/test.py

setUp(self)
Initializes a test client and a test user.
Creates a test file content and sets it up for file upload.
test_file_upload(self)
Tests file upload functionality by posting the test file to the designated endpoint.
Checks if the response status code is 302 (assuming a redirect occurs).
Verifies if the uploaded file is saved in the database.
test_file_list(self)
Tests file listing functionality by uploading a file and then retrieving the file list.
Checks if the response status code is 200.
Verifies if the uploaded file appears in the file list.
test_file_download(self)
Tests file download functionality by uploading a file and then attempting to download it.
Retrieves the first uploaded file from the database.
Checks if the response status code is 200.
Compares the downloaded file content with the originally uploaded file content.
tearDown(self)
Cleans up after each test method.
Deletes any files uploaded during the tests to maintain a clean test environment.
This test case ensures that the file uploading, listing, and downloading functionalities of the Django application are working as expected by asserting against expected behaviors and outcomes.
